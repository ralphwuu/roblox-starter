# Roblox starter (just openroblox.py)
is a Python script that locates installed Roblox player client
and studio binaries and runs them on request (client gets run 
upon script execution and Studio will be prompted to launch!)

The script only runs under Windows, it also has a Windows-pnly
 dependency (msvcrt)
